  <h3>Manual data entry and submission</h3>
  <p>The initial (empty) form is generated using <i>form = FormName()</i>, which is sent to this page in the <i>context</i> dictionary. Clicking the button activates the usual method of sending a post request to the view, and binding the form with <i>form = FormName(request.POST)</i>. Note if a user does not exist, or an error is thrown, there will be a message printed to stdout, and you will return to this page with their name in the character field. See <i>views.manual</i> for the code.</p>

  <form action = "{% url 'd2_api:manual' %}" method = "POST">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ save_user_form }}
    <button type = "submit">Add user</button>
  </form>
